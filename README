Bubble Chamber is an Android 'Live Wallpaper'. It's designed to be restful, with a very slow frame-rate, not eye-catching or flashy.

Bubble Chamber is based on an original artwork by J. Tarbell of Oct 2003. Find out more about his "bubble chamber" pictures and the algorithm behind them at http://complexification.net/gallery/machines/bubblechamber
